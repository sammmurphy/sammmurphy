                     Welcome to my website!
      My name is Samm Murphy and I am making this website to showcase the percentage of americans who prefer dogs to cats. <br/>
      As someone who does not have a preference this is a very interesting topic that is very near and dear to my heart. <br/>
      <br/>
      
      https://www.statista.com/forecasts/978845/preference-of-dogs-vs-cats-in-the-us <br/>
      
      The webiste provided above showcases a pie chart of people who prefer dogs, cats, like them equally, and dislikes them equally.<br/>
      However, if I were to conduct my.own study, I would not provide the last two options and make people pick a dog or cat to get a better data set for what I am interested in.<br/>
