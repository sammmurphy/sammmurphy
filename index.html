                     Welcome to my website!
      My name is Samm Murphy and I am making this website to showcase the percentage of americans who prefer dogs to cats, as someone who does not have a preference
      this is a very interesting topic that is very near and dear to my heart.

      The webiste provided above showcases a pie chart of people who prefer dogs, cats, like them equally, and dislikes them equally. However, if I were to conduct my
      own study, I would not provide the last two options and make people pick a dog or cat to get a better data set for what I am interested in.
